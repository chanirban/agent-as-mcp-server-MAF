# Annotated file: mcp-ping.py
# Purpose: This file is annotated with explanatory comments for clarity when publishing to GitHub.
# NOTE: No executable code has been changedâ€”only comments were added.
#
# Key ideas covered in these annotations:
# - What the file does in the overall MCP + Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF) architecture.
# - How STDIO client/server works for MCP (JSON-RPC over stdin/stdout).
# - Where authentication, environment variables, and model settings are used.
# - How tools and agents are composed and exposed to clients like VS Code Copilot Agents.
